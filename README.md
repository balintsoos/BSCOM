My Interactive Portfolio and Resume site [Check it out!](http://balintsoos.com)

> I am buliding an "Interactive Resume" site, highly rely on frameworks and libraries such as MVC frameworks like Angular.js or Knockout.js, CSS preprocessors like SASS, taskers like Grunt, package managers like Bower, etc etc. This website is just like a playground. I always tweak it, playing with new stuff to create the best workflow for myself and learn as much as possible.

## Production
First, you should install depedencies:
* `$ node install`
* `$ bower install`

To build the releasable site:
* `$ grunt`
or to working on the site:
* `$ grunt dev`

IMPORTANT!
If you would like to edit the `build` folder, you should know that your changes live until the next grunt build or until you change something in the `src` folder if you start grunt with `$ grunt dev` command.
Never upload the src folder to the server, it's for development purposes only.

## Used technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sass
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Knockout.js
* Waypoints.js
* Iconate.js
* Grunt
* Bower

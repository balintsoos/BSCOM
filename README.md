## Production
First, you should install depedencies:
`$ node install`

To build the releasable site:
`$ grunt`

To working on the site:
`$ grunt dev`

IMPORTANT!
If you would like to edit the `build` folder, you should know that your changes live until the next grunt build or until you change something in the `src` folder if you start grunt with `$ grunt dev` command.
Never upload the src folder to the server, it's for development purposes only.

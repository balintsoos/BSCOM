My Interactive Portfolio and Resume site

[Check it out!](http://www.balintsoos.com)

> I am buliding an "Interactive Resume" site, highly rely on frameworks and libraries such as MVC frameworks like Angular.js or Knockout.js, CSS preprocessors like SASS, taskers like Gulp, package managers like Bower, etc. This website is just like a playground. I always tweak it, playing with new stuff to create the best workflow for myself and learn as much as possible.

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies
`$ npm install`
2. Run Gulp

`$ gulp` or `$ gulp build`

**IMPORTANT!**
If you would like to edit the `build` folder, you should know that your changes live until the next gulp build
or until you change something in the `src` folder if you start gulp with `$ gulp watch` command.
Never upload the src folder to the server, it's for development purposes only.
